The project is composed of two folder representing the two way to send a file using the local network.
User have to give args to the program to use it : IP Adress, Port, File to send.

## Prerequisites
A unix distribution and a C compiler : gcc.

> ### How to compile the applications (Quick mode !)
> 1. Navigate to the right folder UDP or FTP with a console.
> 2. Enter :

You can now use the program client to send your file and server to receive the file.
